Got it — you want the steps **from scratch**, starting as if NOTHING is on your local machine, only code in the remote GitHub repo under branch `dev`.

Here are the exact steps:

---

# ✅ FULL PROCESS FROM ZERO (starting fresh)

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo from GitHub

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

Example:

```
git clone git@github.com:company/project.git
```

---

### 2️⃣ Go inside the project

```
cd project
```

---

### 3️⃣ Switch to the dev branch

```
git checkout dev
```

If the branch doesn’t exist locally yet:

```
git fetch
git checkout dev
```

---

### 4️⃣ Pull the latest code from remote dev

```
git pull origin dev
```

---

### 5️⃣ Make your changes

(Edit the files in VSCode / IntelliJ / etc)

---

### 6️⃣ Check modified files

```
git status
```

---

### 7️⃣ Add your changed files

```
git add .
```

---

### 8️⃣ Commit your changes

```
git commit -m "Your change message"
```

---

### 9️⃣ Push back to the same branch (dev)

```
git push origin dev
```

---

# ✔️ Finished!

Your updated code is now in the dev branch on GitHub.

---

# 🧠 Example workflow (practically)

```
git clone https://github.com/priacc-innovations/version-2.git
cd version-2
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

--- make changes in code ---

git add .
git commit -m "fixed login bug in dev"
git push origin dev
```

---

# 🔥 Common mistakes to avoid

❌ editing files before pulling latest
❌ committing on `main` by accident
❌ pushing uncommitted changes
❌ accidentally `git push origin main`

✔ how to resolve merge conflicts
✔ how to undo a local commit
