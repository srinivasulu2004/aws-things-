Here bro — the **exact steps to install the AWS CLI on your EC2 server (Linux / Ubuntu / Amazon Linux)**.

This is the correct and safe method approved by AWS.

---

# ✅ **STEP 1 — Update your server**

Run this first:

```
sudo apt update -y
```

(If you are using Amazon Linux, use `sudo yum update -y`)

---

# ✅ **STEP 2 — Download AWS CLI v2**

Run:

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

---

# ✅ **STEP 3 — Unzip**

```
sudo apt install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

---

# ✅ **STEP 4 — Install AWS CLI**

```
sudo ./aws/install
```

---

# ✅ **STEP 5 — Verify Installation**

```
aws --version
```

You should see something like:

```
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x Linux/x86_64
```

---

# 🟦 VERY IMPORTANT REMINDER

You should **NOT** run `aws configure` on the server.

Because your EC2 instance will use **IAM Role** (not access keys).

---

# 🔥 **HOW TO TEST IAM ROLE**

After installing AWS CLI, test like this:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see something like:

```
"Arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/project-ec2-s3-role/i-0abc12345",
```

This confirms:

✔ IAM Role is attached
✔ No need to login
✔ No access keys needed

Then you can test S3:

```
aws s3 ls s3://teamhub-images
```

---

# 🟩 If you need, I can give:

✔ Step-by-step: attach IAM role to EC2
✔ Full IAM policies
✔ Test commands
✔ How developers use S3

Just tell me.
