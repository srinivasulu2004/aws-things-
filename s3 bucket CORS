Yes ✅ — for **temporary development**, your approach is fine.

Since you don’t have a domain right now, you can use:

### ✅ Temporary CORS (Development Only)

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"]
  }
]
```

This will allow:

* Upload profile picture
* Update profile picture
* Delete profile picture
* Download files

From anywhere (including localhost).

---

# ⚠️ But Very Important

Because you are storing:

* Payslips (sensitive data)
* Profile pictures

Make sure:

### 1️⃣ Bucket Public Access is BLOCKED

Go to:

S3 → teamhub-storage-new → Permissions
✔ Block all public access → ON

CORS ≠ Public access.

CORS only allows browser communication.
It does NOT make your bucket public.

# 🔥 When You Get Domain (Production Setup)

Then change to:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-domain.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

This is correct production configuration 👍

# 🧠 One More Important Thing

If you are uploading **directly from frontend**, the best secure way is:

👉 Backend generates **Pre-signed URL**
👉 Frontend uploads using that URL
👉 Bucket stays private
👉 No public IAM policy

That is production standard.

---

# 🎯 Final Answer

Yes ✅
Your plan is correct:

* Now → `"*"` for testing
* Later → restrict to your domain

Just ensure:

* Bucket is private
* No public bucket policy
* IAM role controls access

If you want, I can next:

* Give you sample pre-signed URL backend code
* Or review your full Attendance Portal S3 security design
